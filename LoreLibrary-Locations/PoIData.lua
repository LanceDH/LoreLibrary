Some time later, Highborne, who defected from Queen Azshara, foolishly attempted to convince the kaldorei race of the power of magic by unleashing a magical storm upon Ashenvale, though it was forbidden. Thus, the Highborne were exiled. Some years after the War of the Ancients, the Satyrs gathered the few demons that remained and engaged in a war across Ashenvale in the War of the Satyr.<BR/><BR/>Afterwards Malfurion entered the Emerald Dream and Tyrande and her Sentinels continued to patrol Ashenvale.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Third War</H1><P><BR/>A group of goblins under Neeloc Greedyfingers had started deforesting the area before the Warsong Clan arrived, but were prevented from doing much damage by the local furbolg tribe. The orcs acquired the goblins' aid after ending this threat. The elusive dark trolls had a village here. Powerful artifacts, enclosed in circles of mushrooms, were protected by forest guardians.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">World of Warcraft</H1><P><BR/>Ashenvale is an ancient forest, and has been in the caring hands of the night elves for thousands of years. It was not until more recent years that things changed, with the coming of the Horde's lumber harvesting camps, as well as other much more insidious groups. The demons of the Burning Legion have holdings in Fire Scar Shrine, Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge. The vile satyr inhabit ancient elven ruins at Xavian, Night Run, and Satyrnaar. Cursed green dragonkin have slipped out from the Emerald Dream portal at Bough Shadow, and corruption taints the Ruins of Stardust. The Horde have seized control of several holdings in the eastern parts of the forest, and beyond their base at Splintertree Post, they have harvested the trees for lumber at the Warsong Lumber Camp and the Warsong Labor Camp. The Horde clash with the night elves over control of Eastern Ashenvale, with the Warsong Outriders vowing to continue their lumber harvesting operations, and the Silverwing Sentinels vowing to drive the Outriders from their lands once and for all.<BR/><BR/>Ashenvale is a vast primordial wilderness long given over to beasts and nature’s savage ways. The night elves who settled on Kalimdor after the Sundering hunted in Ashenvale’s wilds but never settled within its borders. When the Burning Legion invaded in the Third War, the night elves ceased even hunting in order to battle the demons. The lack of hunting has allowed many creatures to live and thrive within the vast woodland, creating danger for all who venture into the forest. Ashenvale forest runs in a great arc south of Mount Hyjal, with Stonetalon Mountains to the southwest and the Barrens directly south. The ruined lands of Azshara lie across a river to the east. Ashenvale is an old forest, long untouched by any mortal race. The weather is fairly mild, though rain is almost constant. The woods are so old and thickly grown that only trickles of precipitation get through the thick canopy. The forest has become ever wilder since left to its own devices after the start of the Third War. Any roads through are overgrown, some even impassable. In contrast, the game trails see increased traffic as beasts living in the shelter of the massive trees grow in number and boldness. Those traveling through Ashenvale will wisely keep their guard up at all times. In recent years, the demons and satyr have corrupted parts of Ashenvale, and other parts of it are cut down by the Horde to fuel their expansion efforts. The Forsaken, too, have begun experimenting on sleeping druids within the Dor'Danil Barrow Den, unbeknownst to the Horde but not the Alliance.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm</H1><P><BR/>Two attacks happened here during the time before the Shattering. Firstly, a horrific attack on night elves Sentinels by orcs, though not from the Horde. The elves were skinned and placed by trees. Secondly, when the druids of Cenarion Circle set up a meeting led by Hamuul Runetotem and Elerethe Renferal. The orcs attacked again and slaughtered all the tauren and night elves druids. The only survivor of the massacre was Hamuul.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Wolfheart</H1><P><BR/>Garrosh Hellscream became the new Warchief of the Horde in the wake of the Cataclysm and unleashed great war in the forests of Ashenvale. He sent orcish warriors and goblins engineers into the heart of forests, where great battles where fought against Sentinels led by Haldrissa Woodshaper, commander of the night elf forces protecting Ashenvale. In an attempt to get help, she sent her best scout Aradria Cloudflyer to Darnassus, but she was struck down by an orcish archers. Aradria was thought dead but fortunately, a druid Parsis rescued her and she was able to deliver her message to Darnassus. Moreover, eight Magnataurs and proto-drakes were brought from Northrend and released against defenseless Night elven Sentinels. Garrosh intended to build another city of the Horde in the center of Ashenvale, which would rival Orgrimmar. Many Night Elven outposts have fallen since the invasion. Tyrande Whisperwind, Shandris Feathermoon with Sentinels, and Alliance troops went to Ashenvale to help relieve Haldrissa's elves, but in the chaos of the battle, Haldrissa was slain and Tyrande was wounded. The battle became bleak. However, Varian Wrynn, Genn Greymane and the army of Worgens arrived to turn the tide. Varian himself stood against the new Warchief. It was a fierce battle but Goldrinn's blessing of unyielding energy gave Varian the advantage over his foe. Before anyone could strike a mortal blow, a dying magnataur divided the two combatants and Garrosh with the attacking Horde were forced to retreat. Su'ura Swiftarrow took Haldrissa's position and new better-situated outposts were quickly commissioned along the eastern edge of the territory. The Alliance reclaimed and rebuilt Silverwing Outpost which was made the staging ground for supplying the Alliance’s counterattack. Before leaving, Tyrande blessed Silverwing Outpost.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Cataclysm</H1><P><BR/>Following the Cataclysm, Garrosh Hellscream took on the mantle of Warchief, and as one of his first campaigns, he led the Horde in taking Azshara completely for the Horde, with the help of his new goblin allies. After a successful attack on Talrendis Point in Azshara, the Horde was able to take control of all of Azshara. Next, the Horde military sent troops to reinforce Mor'shan Ramparts, which had fallen victim to a renewed effort by the Silverwing Sentinels to drive out the Horde from Ashenvale. The Silverwing sentinels weren't just laying siege to the Mor'shan Ramparts, however: they were also launching simultaneous attacks on Splintertree Post and the Warsong Lumber Camp. Eventually, the Horde adventurers and military were able to break the siege of the Ramparts. Pushing north from the Ramparts, the Horde took control of Silverwing Outpost, and using Kodo Caravans, they were soon able to break the siege of Splintertree Post. An orcish warlock poisoned the forest heart, which struck a huge blow to the Sentinels. Horde covert operatives killed the commanders leading the siege of Warsong Lumber Camp, thus bringing the alliance offensive to an end.<BR/><BR/>After the sieges of Splintertree and Warsong Lumber camp were broken, eastern Ashenvale was under complete horde control, save for Forest Song. The Horde armies pressed westward, taking control of Silverwind Refuge by using a corrupted form of a water elemental, and also began an attack on Raynewood Tower and Raynewood Retreat, killing many of the druids and sentinels stationed there. However, the Horde was not able to deliver the finishing blow at Raynewood, as the Druid leader continued to revive the Dryad defenders of the post. The Horde even started firebombing Astranaar, and with victory in sight, they moved in to take Maestra’s Post, one of the few remaining Alliance encampments. If Maestra's post fell, all of Darkshore and eventually Teldrassil would be vulnerable to continued Horde attacks. While the siege of Maestra’s post was beginning, the Horde engineers at the captured Alliance base of Silverwind Refuge were finishing up a giant bomb, designed to be used on the Night Elves in Stonetalon Mountains. Many of the Horde battalions started to move south to reinforce Krom’gar’s army in Stonetalon, bringing the bomb south with them.<BR/><BR/>This success was short lived, however, when the mobilized armies of Darnassus were able to break the siege of Maestra’s post, and pushed the Horde out of Astranaar. After pushing the Horde out of Astranaar, the Alliance armies reinforced Raynewood retreat, breaking the siege there by taking on the shade of the Ancient spirit of Shadumbra, and killing many horde soldiers and destroying their demolishers in the process. Alliance heroes rebuilt Dartol's Rod which allowed them control over the Furbolgs near Silverwind refuge, using them to weaken the Horde army there enough to allow the Sentinel's to retake the camp. The alliance military moved back eastward, cleansing the tainted forest heart and killing the Horde overseer at the Lumber Camp, along with a Sin'dorei Ambassador. At this point, only pockets of horde resistance remained, bringing the war full circle, in favor of the alliance.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Mists of Pandaria</H1><P><BR/>During the Siege of Orgrimmar, the Night Elven sentinels were able to push through Eastern Ashenvale, and eventually reach the Capital City of Orgrimmar, bringing the gates of the city down with Glaive throwers. With the dismantlement of Warchief Garrosh Hellscream's war machine and the conclusion of the Alliance-Horde War, Tyrande Whisperwind allowed the Horde unimpeded access to Azshara's lumber in return for the complete withdrawal of Horde forces from Ashenvale. The results remain to be seen.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

The Horde scout, Ag'tor Bloodfist, helped Horde adventurers down the traitorous Magus Rimtori during the Betrayed quest line. The sea giant Demigod Arkkoroc and his sons sought help against the Hydra queen Hetaera. Lastly, the Demon hunter Loramus Thalipedes aided adventurers in battling the Dreadlord Razelikh the Defiler by forging Azsharite weapons.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Pearl of Pandaria</H1><P><BR/>Li Li Stormstout, Strongbo and her uncle Chen Stormstout fought against Zhahara Darksquall and Rahjak on an isle in Azshara.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Shattering</H1><P><BR/>The Shattering radically changed the balance of power in Azshara. The Bilgewater Cartel goblins, the Horde's newest ally, have made their home here, building a city into the cliff side, and destroying the Azshara Crater to make way for a large quarry. To show their loyalty to the Horde, the goblins have reshaped Azshara into a giant Horde symbol.<BR/><BR/>Having recently gained the mantle of warchief, Garrosh Hellscream is preparing for war to claim all of Kalimdor for the Horde. The goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel, headquartered in Bilgewater Harbor, are playing their part by building war machines, constructing weapons, and establishing a massive naval harbor within sight of Orgrimmar. Meanwhile, the night elves aren't content to sit idly by; they fully intend to challenge this unwelcome occupation in Azshara and hopefully stymie a conflict that would otherwise be carried deep into their forests. Amid all this tension, the Bilgewater Cartel is also out to make a name for itself in true goblin fashion. What is the best way to show solidarity? Reshape the Bay of Storms into a giant Horde symbol! From there, a secret lab, an extensive rocketway, and a \"pleasure palace\" with its own golf course are just natural leaps in goblin logic. Azshara is now the largest terraforming project on Azeroth - whether it's sculpting the terrain to promote Horde propaganda, moving an entire mountain to pillage the minerals underneath, or slapping the face of the trade prince on a nearby crag, there's no question who wears the pants in Azshara these days.<BR/><BR/>Kalec is rounding up all of the blue dragonflight, as he fears the death of Malygos will be a sign of weakness and Deathwing will send out agents to assassinate the remaining dragons within the flight. This holds true as the black dragonflight has invaded Azshara to hunt down Azuregos. Kalec and Azuregos help low level Horde players to repel the invasion.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

Not visited often by the night elves and tauren of Kalimdor due to their out-of-the-way location, the isles' indigenous creatures have been left to their own devices over the centuries. This is also the reason why the other races have not yet noticed the crashed dimensional ship that lies scattered across the islands, now used by the surviving draenei as a set of bases and outposts.<BR/><BR/>Some civilization did exist on the island before the draenei arrived. On the southern Silvermyst Isle, a dock and house of night elf architecture marks the dwelling of a family of night elves who made their home here. In addition, a clan of furbolgs live in the central island. Due to being so far removed from their cousins in Kalimdor, these furbolgs have remained uncorrupted, though they have recently been driven out of their ancestral holdings.<BR/><BR/>Additionally, ancient night elven ruins predating the Sundering are found scattered about both Azuremyst and Bloodmyst, all of them now inhabited by vile naga.The night elves have mostly abandoned these islands in favor of mainland Kalimdor.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Cataclysm</H1><P><BR/>After the Cataclysm, rumors had spread that the draenei withstood the breaking of the world, and that refuge could be found on Azuremyst Isle. Human refugees arrived in lost humility at first, in ones and twos, by leaky boat and makeshift raft, risking the unknown to flee the horribly known. In the beginning, the draenei had aided as they could, giving the refugees a place outside the Exodar, healing them, and sharing food and water. But then the outcasts had begun sending out word to find their friends and families, and the call echoed throughout Kalimdor: \"The Prophet holds Azuremyst safe. The Prophet foresaw the Cataclysm and will make everything right.\" and the refugee camp quickly grew and boasted a thousand exiles.  When the draenei tested the nearly repaired Exodar, the refugees thought the draenei were going to leave Azeroth, and started rioting. The riots escalated and both human and draenei were wounded in the conflict. The riots were stopped when High Prophet Velen spoke collectively to both sites, and not long after the refugees started returning to their former homes, to help rebuilt the world after the Cataclysm.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

Originally known as Silvergale when the draenei first landed, it was once as beautiful as nearby Azuremyst Isle. The island was corrupted by blood red crystals from the draenei's dimensional ship, the Exodar. Blood-like liquid seeps from many of the crystals into the ground. The corruption from the liquid caused creatures and plants to become irradiated. The air was polluted with red-tinted mist from the red liquid. Due to the corruption the island was renamed \"Bloodmyst\". The island has for a long time lain out of view from central Kalimdor, and has largely been left to itself by the neighboring tauren and night elves. It is likely that this is why many enemies of the night elves, such as satyrs and naga, have found a haven here. When the Exodar crashed on Azuremyst Isle, several large pieces of the dimensional ship fell on Bloodmyst. These pieces are now used both by the draenei and by other creatures as a form of shelter.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

Much of the coastline was destroyed in the Sundering, and it was many years before the night elves began to rebuild in the area.<BR/><BR/>After the Sundering, some night elves settled in the continent's northern reaches, on and near Mount Hyjal, including the port at the mountain's northern foot. However, the few night elves in Darkshore left the area in the course of the Third War, moving to the safety of Mount Hyjal and the Moonglade. A small number of night elves returned after the war to the cold and desolate beach to revive the port. They dwelt in the village of Auberdine, which was used as a ferry outpost.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Cataclysm</H1><P><BR/>Darkshore took a heavy toll from the Shattering — its landscape was wrecked, perhaps more thoroughly than any other part of Azeroth. Auberdine was completely destroyed, the ground was cracked and flooded with streams and whirlpools, and there are fires, storms and other hazards of nature ravaging the zone. The night elves are in survival mode, helping refugees and, wherever they can, fending off the advances of the Twilight's Hammer cult, the naga, and the Shatterspear trolls. Meanwhile, Malfurion Stormrage, recently returned from the Emerald Dream, has traveled to the epicenter of the destruction and called upon the ancient powers of Cenarius to contain it.<BR/><BR/>The Grove of the Ancients was shielded from most of the devastation caused by the Cataclysm, due in large part to the power of the ancient guardians residing therein. Protecting the grove required an enormous amount of energy, though, and as a result, most of the guardians have gone into a sort of slumber. Adventurers will have to figure out a way to wake them and bring them into the fight to ensure the survival of Darkshore.<BR/><BR/>The night elves built the town of Lor'danel further north from Aubderdine, in order to mantain some foothold on Darkshore. The village is made up of new buildings, as the night elves cleared away the ruins they could not restore. Most of the night elves currently living in Darkshore have focused their attention on reclaiming Auberdine and helping out any survivors that can be found.<BR/><BR/>After the Shattering, the Shatterspear trolls started establishing footholds on northern Darkshore, and the night elves have responded by scouting and preparing to defend the area from the seemingly hostile trolls.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

Such an adjustment was far from easy, and there were many night elves who could not adjust to the prospects of aging, disease and frailty. Seeking to regain their immortality, a number of wayward druids conspired to plant a special tree that would reestablish a link between their spirits and the eternal world. With Malfurion Stormrage missing, Fandral Staghelm — the leader of those who wished to plant the new World Tree - became the new Arch-Druid. In no time at all, he and his fellow druids had forged ahead and planted the great tree, Teldrassil, off the stormy coasts of northern Kalimdor. Under their care, the tree sprouted up above the clouds. Among the twilight boughs of the colossal tree, the wondrous city of Darnassus took root. Darnassus was built to honor the survival of the night elven race.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">World of Warcraft</H1><P><BR/>Darnassus is a part of Teldrassil, a giant tree in the middle of the ocean. It is the capital city of the Night Elves and after the third war they sided with the Alliance to repel the nature hating orc. While they still hold a bond with their druid cousins, they didn't take it lightly when they joined the Horde. The easy way to enter the city is by taking a portal found at Rut'Theran Village and to return to the village you simply take the same one. Most notable people to reside here are Fandral Staghelm where he sends adventurers to do some tasks and Tyrande Whisperwind who is the official leader of their society. The city is an Alliance only territory.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Stormrage</H1><P><BR/>Malfurion returned from the Emerald Dream and helped imprison Fandral, who, as it turned out, had been turned insane by Lord Xavius and responsible for the corruption of Teldrassil. Malfurion, druids and Alexstrasza with Ysera redeemed and blessed the Tree. Arch-Druid Stormrage now stands in the Temple of the Moon alongside his beloved.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Cataclysm</H1><P><BR/>With worgen and human refugees coming in from Gilneas, the Howling Oak was grown from a seed taken from Gilneas to serve as a home for them.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Wolfheart</H1><P><BR/>In the wake of the Cataclysm, Tyrande and Malfurion conducted a summit near Darnassus in order to vote the proud worgen of Gilneas into the Alliance. However, resentment of Gilneas and its ruler, Genn Greymane, runs deep in Stormwind's King Varian Wrynn. His refusal to forgive Genn for closing his nation off from the rest of the world years ago endangers more than just the summit: it threatens to unravel the Alliance itself. However, Varian's animosity was only one of many unsettling developments in Darnassus. An uneasiness creeps over the once-immortal night elves as the first of them fall victim to the infirmities of age. While they cope with their mortality, tensions flare over the reintroduction of the Highborne, formerly the highest caste of night elf nobility, into their society. Many night elves are unable to pardon the Highborne for the destruction unleashed on Azeroth millennia ago by their reckless use of magic. When a murdered Highborne was discovered on the outskirts of Darnassus, Malfurion and Tyrande move to stop further bloodshed and unrest by appointing one of the night elves' most cunning and skilled agents to find the killer: the renowned warden Maiev Shadowsong. Jarod Shadowsong, Maiev's brother, had also returned, and brought his wife with him in attempt to heal her of her illness. Jarod then cooperated with Maiev in helping her with her case. Meanwhile, Malfurion attempted to mend fences between Varian and Genn. After the battle for Ashenvale was over, the identity of the Highborne murderer was discovered and the Alliance resolved their issues and voted Gilneas back into the Alliance.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Landfall</H1><P><BR/>Thanks to the efforts of Agent Connelly, the Alliance found out what the horde were up to and took the upper hand. Night elf sentinels located the hidden crypt, found and secured the Divine Bell and took it to Darnassus, all thanks to the sacrifice of Sarannha Skyglaive. However, it was all in vain, as a sunreaver agent working for the horde infiltrated the city under the banner of neutrality by the Kirin Tor and entered undetected, he located the bell in the Cenarion Enclave and teleported it to Silvermoon City. After learning of the theft, Jaina goes to its former location and found specs of magic leading a path to the city's exit. After finding the source, she saw a portal leading to Dalaran and it was at this point that she realized that action needs to be taken. Soon after the discovery, the Purge of Dalaran began.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

Drawn by faint elemental whisperings, the tauren became convinced that somewhere beneath the meadows, the Earth Mother herself dwelled. After decades of attempting to rouse her from her slumber, the shaman eventually succeeded, but to their horror they realized that what they had awakened was not the benevolent Earth Mother, but the enormous earth elemental Princess Theradras, daughter of Therazane the Stonemother. The newly awakened Theradras reached out to the verdant surroundings for sustenance and consumed their energies in order to regenerate her weakened form. The tauren would later name this now barren land \"Desolace\".<BR/><BR/>The sudden monumental loss of life sent ripples throughout all of Azeroth and even the Emerald Dream. Zaetar, son of the forestlord Cenarius, traveled to Desolace to investigate, but though he had decided to imprison Theradras, he instead fell in love with her. Theradras requited Zaetar's affection, and the two became mates. From this forbidden and unnatural union, the centaur were born.

The demonic curse on their kind ended, the Horde changed from a bloodthirsty, warlike juggernaut into more of a loose coalition, dedicated to survival and prosperity rather than conquest. Aided by the noble tauren and the cunning trolls of the Darkspear tribe, Thrall and his orcs looked forward to a new era of peace in their own land. From there, they began the creation of the great warrior city, Orgrimmar. Named after the former Warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, the new city was constructed in a short amount of time, with the aid of goblins, tauren, trolls, and the Mok'Nathal Rexxar.

Archdruid Fandral Staghelm took over the leadership of the night elven druids, convincing the Circle of the Ancients in Darkshore that it was time for the night elven people to rebuild the World Tree and regain their cherished immortality. However, his plan failed because Nozdormu, the source of the night elves immortality, did not bless the tree due to the selfishness of the night elves' wish.<BR/><BR/>The Circle of the Ancients and powerful druids combined their powers to grow an immense tree in the Veiled Sea. They called the tree Teldrassil, meaning \"crown of the earth\" in Darnassian. The night elves made their new home in the boughs of Teldrassil, creating a forest of mighty trees and flowing rivers, bathed in the endless night that fell over the lands of the elves from the dawn of time.<BR/><BR/>However, the calm of the enchanted forest slowly fallen into the shadow of a sinister presence. Satyrs, Furbolgs, and other beasts appeared in Teldrassil, occupying all the attention of the vigilant Sentinels and the wise druids to ensure the safety of their new home. The source of this corruption remained a mystery for some time, until the conflict of the Emerald Nightmare spilled into the waking world.<BR/><BR/>Malfurion, upon arriving at Darnassus, discovered that a remnant of a great evil was grafted into Teldrassil by Fandral. By grafting Xavius' fel-tainted branch into Teldrassil Xavius and the evil behind his transformation into the Nightmare Lord were given a tie to both Azeroth and the Emerald Dream<BR/><BR/>The archdruid managed to remove the branch that was corrupted and eventually restored the tree to what it was supposed to be in the first place. Alexstrasza, impressed that the tree could prosper alone without her influence or her kin's, blessed it belatedly. She and Ysera later gave a second blessing during the wedding of Malfurion and Tyrande Whisperwind. The tree flourishes even more under the gifts from the Life-Binder and She of the Dreaming, even if still being unable to return the night elves' immortality due to the continued absence of any blessing from Nozdormu.<BR/><BR/>Of late, Teldrassil’s recovery has slowed, and signs of the Nightmare’s corruption have resurfaced. Already burdened by political tension and the vast destruction unleashed by the Cataclysm, the night elves must now ascertain the cause of their beloved World Tree’s ailment and refocus their efforts on the dire situation facing Azeroth.<BR/><BR/>It is later revealed that the \"growing corruption\" is actually Teldrassil purging itself of the corruption that has burdened it with taint and perverted it's growth for all of the years it's been in existence. With the corruption having been buried deep inside Teldrassil, it would have been impossible to strike at the source without killing the world tree itself. The aspects' blessing has allowed Teldrassil to force the taint to the surface in a form that the night elves can destroy. The Bough of Corruption was the one last remnant of Xavius that remained to torment the night elf people on Teldrassil and was the source of the Fel Moss that has tainted the gnarlpine, the timberlings, and everything else.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>e city, as well as the blood elves and Bilgewater Cartel goblins who have more recently been accepted into the Horde.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Wrath of the Lich King</H1><P><BR/>During the War against the Lich King, Putress betrayed Forsaken.

The naaru dispersed throughout the ravaged world, leaving the fortress defenseless. Seeing an opportunity to strike, Kael'thas Sunstrider and his many blood elf legions assaulted Tempest Keep and captured it, taking possession of its treasures and kidnapping the sole naaru occupant, M'uru, sending him back to Silvermoon City for the magisters to utilize in their thirst for magic. M'uru later becomes a boss in Sunwell Plateau, transforming into the corrupt Entropius.<BR/><BR/>Velen, the courageous prophet who had led the draenei people since their exodus from Argus millennia before, had hid with the remainder of his people in the wake of the Legion-instigated orcish onslaught. With the Broken Farseer Nobundo, first of the draenei shaman, at his side, the Prophet personally led a raid on Tempest Keep to wrest control of one of its satellite structures, the Exodar.<BR/><BR/>It is unknown how the draenei accomplished this, or what happened next, but the draenei took control of the Exodar and used it to escape Outland. The blood elves and the draenei traitor Sironas, discovering what the draenei were planning, sabotaged the dimensional engines of the vessel. When the draenei activated it, the engine malfunctioned and sent the Exodar hurtling out of control through the Twisting Nether until it reached the closest habitable planet, Azeroth. The crippled ship screamed across the skies of Northern Kalimdor, crystals flying everywhere, until it crash-landed on a small island chain off the coast of Darkshore. The survivors took the islands as their new homeland, and set up their new capital in the largest intact portion of the still-smoking ship. The surviving blood elves regrouped and, after scouting the area, summoned reinforcements from Tempest Keep with the Sun Gate.<BR/><BR/>In the short story Prophet's Lesson, which takes place after the Shattering, The Exodar is nearly repaired. According to Vindicator Romnar, all key systems have been repaired, and they are now just cleaning up and bolstering any areas of apparent weakness. He states they should have The Exodar up and running, and operational within a week, and by the end of the short story Vindicator Maraad announces that it has been fully repaired.<BR/><BR/>After the Legion attacks the Exodar and slays O'ros, Velen orders Romuul to begin repairs and states that the draenei are going home.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Contamination of the Azuremyst Isles</H1><P><BR/>The Exodar's crash caused power crystals from the Exodar to break apart from the ship and land on the island, an event the Stillpine furbolg call the \"crystal storm.\" These crystals would then be ingested by the nearby nightstalkers causing them to become infected with corruption. Exarch Menelaous, from Azure Watch, fearing that the infection will spread if left unchecked assigns young adventures to purge the forests of infected cats.<BR/><BR/>Never seen in Nagrand, the first red elekk calves were born in Azeroth after the Exodar's arrival. Some breeders theorize that the unique coloration is somehow caused by the same radiation which ravaged Bloodmyst Isle.<BR/><BR/>The long-term effects of the contamination caused by the Exodar are still under observation.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

All Horde visitors are welcome here, and the expertise of the tauren in professions ranging from leatherworking to shamanism, druidism to hunting are all practiced and taught here. Unfortunately, the central location of the Thunder Bluff also makes it easily accessible to members of the Alliance. Thus, it is often one of the easier Horde capitals for Alliance players to raid, with Baine being killed long before Horde reinforcements even become an issue.<BR/><BR/>Some time prior the Lich King's awakening, Thunder Bluff's Pools of Vision became haunted by an element rumored to be summoned by Magatha.

They headed to the Spirit Rise, where The Skychaser clan's members were all murdered. The Forsaken below were supporting the Grimtotem, thus they needn't be worried. The hunters of the Hunter Rise were also killed and some others who could lift a weapon was also killed to struck fear to remaining tauren. The reign of Grimtotems was short lived however. Thanks to the effort of Jevan Grimtotem and Jaina Proudmoore, Baine was able to rally an army and buy weapons needed to defeat the Grimtotem in Thunder Bluff. In retaliation, Cairne's son, Baine, launched a brilliant counterattack using a fleet of zeppelins. After he strategically divided Magatha's forces, Baine recaptured Thunder Bluff and assumed his role as the high chieftain of the tauren. Having recovered from the recent unrest, the capital is once again a bastion of peace and security for Kalimdor's tauren. Magatha and her loyalists were sent to an exile.

Ironforge dwarves and gnomes were key in the Horde's defeat, and many nurse grudges against orcs to this day. Not long ago, gnomes in Gnomeregan unearthed the mythic troggs. These tribal creatures slaughtered Gnomeregan's populace and drove the gnomes to Ironforge, where they hide and nurse their wounds.

The resources culled from the bountiful woods helped fuel the Horde's war machine. Much of the forests were razed as the orcs marched across Elwynn. The town of Goldshire and the Abbey at Northshire were both tragically destroyed by the Horde. When Stormwind fell to the orcs and Anduin Lothar led the humans to Lordaeron, the Stormreaver and Twilight's Hammer clans assumed domains in Elwynn forest. When the humans of Stormwind finally retook their city at the end of the Second War, they regained Elwynn as well. It cost the kingdom of Stormwind a significant amount of gold and resources to rebuild their broken homeland. As a result, the kingdom's economy has flagged since it was rebuilt. Many of the middle and lower classes became fed up with high taxes and unpaid labor in service of the kingdom. Many of these dissidents defected to form the Defias Brotherhood (led by the Stonemasons Guild, the architects who reconstructed Stormwind and weren't paid anything). The Brotherhood reaches into Elwynn Forest from time to time, preying on lone travelers, although their main center of operations lies somewhere in Westfall. Some say they have a case against Stormwind, as they weren’t paid for their work rebuilding the city; others say they are whiners who charged too much in the first place.

Thousands of years ago, the forests were claimed by the Highborne, eventually naming themselves the high elves, who battled the resident Amani populace and took the land for their own. The elves established the Kingdom of Quel'Thalas, and northern Eversong contained the heart of their empire for millennia; the elves' capital of Silvermoon was established at the forest's northernmost tip, near the ocean. The elves interwove their architecture to complement Eversong's natural landscape, blending the natural and their arcane-empowered structures together in beautiful ways. The elves lived in relative harmony with the creatures of the woodlands. The magi erected numerous runestones throughout Eversong, to serve as a dampening field that would limit the potency of all non-elven magic. They also magically locked Eversong into a state of perpetual springtime. Shortly after Quel'Thalas was founded, the elves created a legendary bow named Thas'dorah, carved from the bark of the mother tree of Eversong.<BR/><BR/>Although the woods have seen their share of battle between the elves and their relentless neighbors, the forest trolls, the region retained a harmonic and peaceful feel for much of its history, standing strong for over 7,000 years to come. Its defenses were tested during the Second War, in which the edges of the forest mysteriously began to burn. The invaders responsible reached the northern forest, but were unable to overcome Silvermoon's great defenses, and the violence was soon quelled.

The elven grand magister, Belo'vir Salonar, took over the defense of Silvermoon after her death, but the capital was also unable to withstand Arthas's onslaught. After Arthas had reached his goal on Quel'Danas and abandoned Quel'Thalas to its fate, the remnants of elves in the woods gathered under the banner of Lor'themar Theron, who safeguarded the ruined kingdom while searching for any other survivors.<BR/><BR/>Quel'Thalas's king and ruling council had been slain during the onslaught, leaving Kael'thas Sunstrider as the rightful ruler. Kael rushed home to witness the damage to his kingdom with his own eyes, and reunited with his people, renaming them the blood elves in honor of all those perished. Kael'thas left his new regent, Lor'themar, in charge of Quel'Thalas, while he took the strongest elves to battle alongside the Alliance in Lordaeron, and later Illidan Stormrage on Outland.<BR/><BR/>Most of the blood elves remained behind with their regent, seeking to reclaim their land. Downtrodden and weakened by an addiction to magic that had become apparent after the destruction of the elves' Sunwell, the elves made little progress with this until the return of Grand Magister Rommath, who reinvigorated his people with the use of a technique taught to Kael on Outland: mana draining. The elves gathered their strength and began reclaiming and rebuilding; fortunately, most of Eversong was not beyond healing, and the Scourge's defilement that had ruined the Ghostlands to the south was able to be halted at Elrendar. Most of the blood elves remained in Eversong to continue rebuilding, while others turned their attention to the Ghostlands, hoping to drive the Scourge out of their beloved kingdom forever. Large portions of Eversong were reclaimed, and Silvermoon City rose again, but other threats, some old and some new, were looming on the horizon.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Burning Crusade</H1><P><BR/>In the wake of Arthas's invasion, much of Eversong has been reclaimed, but not without cost. The destruction of the Sunwell adversely affected some of Eversong's wildlife (along with the elves' own arcane creations), driving some erratic and hostile. Dealing with this, along with understanding every blood elf's innate addiction to magic, is among the first thing blood elf adventurers must do. Eversong is also troubled by the Wretched, a group of dishevelled, violent mana-addicts who could not balance their dependency on the arcane. Having grown bold with the advent of the elves' recent losses to the Scourge, the Amani forest trolls have made incursions into Eversong, diverting the Farstriders' attention. A south-western portion of Eversong, now known as the Scorched Grove, was burned by the elves in an effort to halt the corruption and the Scourge's advance; while successful, it also turned the local treants hostile.<BR/><BR/>With the Sunwell gone, the elves began using their arcane sanctums around Eversong to syphon arcane power from ley lines in Quel'Thalas. They also revitalized several of the runestones to heighten their defenses, which had fallen into disrepair.<BR/><BR/>Although much of Eversong is restored, the Dead Scar remains a constant reminder of the Scourge invasion. The blood elves looked into ways to heal it, but investigating magisters deemed it too tainted and beyond saving. Roughly half of Silvermoon City was reclaimed; however, its western half remains deteriorated, the Dead Scar slicing through it.<BR/><BR/>Much work has been done to retake Eversong, but much more remains before the wounds Arthas inflicted can be fully healed. The Blood Hawks seem to be guards of the forest.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

However their society grew too large and could no longer be maintained within the confines of their mountain cities. While the mighty High King, Modimus Anvilmar, ruled over all dwarves with justice and wisdom, three powerful factions had arisen amongst the dwarven society. The Bronzebeard clan, ruled by Thane Madoran Bronzebeard, held close ties to the High King and stood as the traditional defenders of Ironforge Mountain. The Wildhammer clan, ruled by Thane Khardros Wildhammer, inhabited the foothills and crags around the base of the mountain and sought to gain more control within the city. The third faction, the Dark Iron clan, ruled by the sorcerer-thane Thaurissan, hid within the deepest shadows under the mountain and plotted against both their Bronzebeard and the Wildhammer cousins.<BR/><BR/>While the three clans were able to live in a tenuous peace, the death of High King Anvilmar (from old age) plunged the three clans into war with the prize being Ironforge itself. After many years of fighting the Bronzebeards, who had the largest standing army, emerged victorious and banished the Dark Irons and Wildhammers from under the mountain. Even as the Wildhammers founded their own kingdom of Grim Batol, the Dark Iron plotted in secret from the newly created home within the Redridge Mountains.<BR/><BR/>Seeking to claim all of Khaz Modan for their own the Dark Irons under Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, Modgud, launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and Grim Batol. The Dark Irons had nearly taken control of both kingdoms when Madoran and Khardros were able to snatch victory and push the Dark Irons back. While Thaurissan survived and fled with his forces, his wife Modgud was killed by Khardros.<BR/><BR/>With common cause between them Ironforge and Grim Batol marched south with the intention of destroying the Dark Irons once and for all. In turn Thaurissan seeking a powerful minion that would ensure his victory accidentally called forth Ragnaros the Firelord, whose rebirth ultimately saw Thaurissan killed and the Dark Irons enslaves to the summoned elemental. The combined Bronzebeard and Wildhammer armies halted their advance and turned back towards kingdoms being unwilling to face the Ragnaros's wrath. Upon learning that Modgud's death had left an evil stain upon Grim Batol King Bronzebeard offered to let the Wildhammers live within the borders of Ironforge, but the the Wildhammers refused and would find home within Lordaeron.<BR/><BR/>Desiring to retain relations and trade with their cousins, the dwarves of Ironforge constructed two massive arches, the Thandol Span, to bridge the gap between Khaz Modan and Lordaeron. Bolstered by mutual trade, the two kingdoms prospered. After the deaths of Madoran and Khardros, their sons jointly commissioned two great statues in honor of their fathers. The two statues would stand guard over the pass into the southlands, which had become volcanic in the wake of Ragnaros' scorching presence. They served as both a warning to all who would attack the dwarven kingdoms, and as a reminder of what price the Dark Irons paid for their crimes. The two kingdoms retained close ties for some years, but the Wildhammers were much changed by the horrors they witnessed at Grim Batol. They took to living above ground on the slopes of Aerie Peak, instead of carving a vast kingdom within the mountain. The ideological differences between the two remaining dwarven clans eventually led to their parting of ways.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Second War and aftermath</H1><P><BR/>Prior to the start of the Second War Ironforge had received missives from Lordaeron.<BR/><BR/>In the years following the Horde's defeat, the leaders of the various Alliance nations began to bicker and argue over territorial holdings and decreasing political influence. King Terenas of Lordaeron, the patron of the Alliance, began to suspect that the fragile pact they had forged during their darkest hour would not stand for long. Terenas had convinced the Alliance leaders to lend money and laborers to help rebuild the city of Stormwind that was destroyed during the orcish occupation of Azeroth. Those taxes, coupled with the high expense of maintaining and operating the numerous orc internment camps, led many leaders - Genn Greymane of Gilneas in particular - to believe that their kingdoms would be better off seceding from the Alliance.<BR/><BR/>To make matters worse, the brusque high elves of Silvermoon rescinded their allegiance to the Alliance, stating that the humans' poor leadership led to the burning of their forests during the Second War. Though Terenas tactfully reminded the Elves that nothing of Quel'Thalas would have remained if not for the hundreds of valiant humans who'd given their lives to defend it, the Elves stubbornly decided to go their own way. In the wake of the Elves' departure, Gilneas and Stromgarde pulled stake and seceded as well.<BR/><BR/>Though the Alliance was falling apart, King Terenas still had allies that he could count on. Both Admiral Proudmoore of Kul Tiras and the young King Varian Wrynn of Azeroth remained committed to the Alliance. Also, the wizards of the Kirin Tor, led by the Archmage Antonidas, pledged Dalaran's steadfast support to Terenas' rule. Most pleasingly, perhaps, was the pledge of the mighty Dwarven King Magni Bronzebeard, who vowed that the Dwarves of Ironforge would forever owe a debt of honor to the Alliance for liberating Khaz Modan from the Horde's control.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Third War</H1><P><BR/>The dwarves of Ironforge battled the Undead Scourge and sent units to aid the rest of the Lordaeron against the undead threat. Even after the fall of Lordaeron Ironforge remained steadfast in it's commitments and aided their allies throughout the Third War. During the war Magni learned that Muradin had died and that Arthas himself was responsible. Magni was overcome with grief at the news of Muradin's demise, but he and the youngest brother, Brann, remained steadfast in their desire to continue serving the dwarven people.<BR/><BR/>Some time after High Inquisitor Fairbanks and Alexandros Mograine visited King Magni. To avenge Muradin, Magni forged the Ashbringer to oppose Frostmourne, Arthas, and the undead. While Magni never took much stock in the belief that Master dwarven blacksmiths could impart emotions into the weapons they create, standing before The Great Anvil, he found himself thinking of how he would not see Muradin again. He thus harnessed all of his rage, fury, the desire for vengeance, and willed them into being with each strike of his hammer. When he was finished, he gave Mograine the finest blade that had ever been crafted by his hand. This would confirm that he is, at the very least, a skilled weaponsmith of the highest degree.<BR/><BR/>For at least part of the Third War, Magni fought alongside Chen Stormstout and declared him to be a friend of Ironforge.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Pearl of Pandaria</H1><P><BR/>Li Li Stormstout and Strongbo journeyed to Ironforge, where he sensed that the earth elementals in the area were in pain. Even after being informed of the dwarven origins Strongbo maintained that the earth was in distress and that he could feel the pressure building, though Li Li pointed out that it didn't mean the dwarves were responsible.<BR/><BR/>The two pandaren ended up attending Brewfest and after fighting back the Dark Iron dwarves met with King Magni, who revealed that Chen that helped him during the Third War. The King further stated that any friend of Chen's was a friend of Khaz Modan and upon Li Li's request, Magni provided the pandaren with a zeppelin and two ram mounts.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm</H1><P><BR/>Following the civil unrest amongst the Dwarves, the Bronzebeard clan emerged victorious. For the following years after the war King Magni Bronzebeard could be found in the High Seat, as the Dwarven leader of Ironforge. However, in recent times King Magni Bronzebeard had fallen ill to a Titanic curse. This left Ironforge in a state of unrest, but soon the paticipants of the War of the Three Hammers returned to Ironforge, to establish the Council of Three Hammers, with representatives from each of the clans, consisting of Moira Thaurissan, Falstad Wildhammer and Muradin Bronzebeard. Together, they have set aside their differences in order to rule the Dwarven city of Ironforge.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Fire and Iron</H1><P><BR/>After returning from Outland to Azeroth around the time of the Shattering, Kurdran returned to Aerie Peak and learned about the situation in Ironforge. He told Falstad, who was chosen by King Wrynn, that he will represent the Wildhammer clan in the Council of Three Hammers, an act not fair to Falstad as he has been leading the dwarves for centuries. Kurdran then traveled to Ironforge to represent the Wildhammer clan in the Council of Three Hammers. Tensions were running high between the Wildhammer clan and the other two clans in Ironforge as they were resentful of the Wildhammer's nonconformist tendencies as well as fearful of the false rumors circulating that said the Wildhammers were using barbaric brutal tactics on their enemies as well as their allies who didn't comply with their demands. Eventually the tensions led to a fight between a Wildhammer and a Bronzebeard that ended in somebody's death.<BR/><BR/>The Bronzebeard clan and the Dark Iron clan had proposed to reforge the Hammer of the High King as an act of unity between the three clans and to ease the rising tensions in Ironforge but in order to do so, they required the scepter that belonged in Kurdran's possession. Though Kurdran was reluctant to part with the scepter for sentimental reasons and saw the reforging of the hammer as a waste of time, he nonetheless handed over the scepter so that the Wildhammer would be better received in Ironforge. Still, Kurdran had trouble adjusting to Ironforge as he missed the open skies of the Hinterlands and was not fond of the politicking required of his position. His troubles were compounded when tensions again rose as a fight broke out between Kurdran and his Wildhammer dwarves and some Dark Iron dwarves, which consequently led to a fire that killed his gryphon Sky'ree.<BR/><BR/>The hammer would later be reforged as an act of unity between the three dwarven clans, under decree of the Council of Three Hammers. It was decided that a dark iron smith should reforge the hammer. A few days before the reforging, the council discovered that the pieces of the hammer might've been fakes. Yet the majority of the council agreed to continue with the reforging without the public knowing about it being a fake. Kurdran however, disagreed with the lie. Later that night, Kurdran would come to where the pieces were stored, and removed the Wildhammer scepter that was to be used as the hammer's handle. During a conversation with Moira Thaurissan, it was implied that she planned on the Wildhammers alienating the other two clans so that tensions between the Dark Irons and the Bronzebeards would lessen. Moira informed Kurdran that his brute strength was useless, and only winning hearts and minds mattered in Ironforge. The night before the reforging, Muradin Bronzebeard advised Kurdran to compromise his principles a little as his beliefs were not only holding himself back, but his clan and the entire city as well.<BR/><BR/>On the day of the reforging, it was discovered that the handle was missing, and Kurdran admitted he had stolen it. But instead of letting it be reforged, he smashed the handle with his stormhammer, and it shattered to pieces. Kurdran declared that the union of the dwarven clans shouldn't start with reforging a hammer that could be fractured again. Instead, Kurdran proposed that the dwarven clans move forward from the past and unite with a fresh start. Gladly, Muradin joined him in fracturing the other fragments while Moira did so reluctantly, her plan quietly foiled at such a public event.<BR/><BR/>Realizing that Falstad was the better dwarf to represent the Wildhammer clan in the Council of Three Hammers, Kurdran decided to step down from his position as Wildhammer representative and traveled to Stormwind to aid King Varian's army.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Cataclysm</H1><P><BR/>With the trouble taken to form the Council of Three Hammers, the dwarves' worries are far from over. When a surprise attack from the Dark Irons who were suppose to be with the Alliance was engaged, Commander Stonebreaker handles the situation and sends one of his scouts to Ironforge with a note claiming that Moira's Dark Irons had attacked the airfield. Moira accused Stonebreaker and the messenger of lying, believing that they were trying to take her son's claim to the throne but Muradin vouched for the commander, claiming that he was loyal and honest to Ironforge. After reviewing the situation and coming with a solution, Moira revealed her discovery that Ambassador Slaghammer had been secretly working for the Twilight's Hammer to undermine her and her \"halfbreed\".<BR/><BR/>During this time Li Li Stormstout visited the city in order to speak with Magni and got into a brief argument with Moira to Falstad's amusement.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Legion</H1><P><BR/>Four years after King Magni's petrification, Moira was asked by Muradin and some of the priests to talk to Magni, as she often did when times were trying, in the hopes that it would wake him up. She however felt that it was a fool's errand, still believing that Magni would still not have approved of her ruling, but did so to keep up appearances. However, to the vast surprise of Moira and Advisor Belgrum, Magni awoke with a mighty crash as a living statue made of diamond. With a voice like a mountainslide, he told Moira and Belgrum that he now spoke for the land and was a part of Azeroth itself. Muradin and Falstad also came down to see him.<BR/><BR/>While the Council of Three Hammers waited for Magni and discussed what the king's return would mean for the political stability of Ironforge upstairs at the High Seat, Magni was taking the time to walk once again through his city, including stopping at the The Great Anvil, seeing the gryphons at the gryphon roost, and kneeling in the pool of the Mystic Ward. By all laws under the mountain, as long as the rightful ruler was alive, the city belonged to him, but Moira and Falstad knew that the Dark Irons and the Wildhammers would never kneel to a Bronzebeard king. However, Magni, having just returned to the throne room, replied that he had not come to reclaim his crown. No longer a king but a servant of Azeroth, he delivered a dire warning about the Burning Legion's return to the three, and that they had to prepare their people—all their people—for what was coming. He then proclaimed that he had to leave immediately to warn the rest of the Alliance.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

Using a stolen vial from the Well of Eternity, Dath'Remar created the sacred Sunwell, a fount of arcane power that would be inherently tied to his people for generations to come. He led the Highborne in the magical construction of their new capital, raising its spires and buildings with their great magical power. The city was constructed primarily out of white stone and living plants in the style of the ancient kaldorei empire and interwoven with the natural topography of the landscape. The Highborne, now calling themselves the high elves, thus founded the kingdom of Quel'Thalas, with Silvermoon City as its crowning jewel. The country was enchanted to remain in a state of perpetual springtime. Silvermoon itself was constructed over the site of sacred troll grounds, which earned the elves further enmity from the neighbouring Amani tribe. Ruled by the Sunstrider Dynasty and the Convocation of Silvermoon (the highest elven lords in Quel'Thalas), the ruling body of the high elves was also based here. Silvermoon became renowned for its grand libraries and seats of magical learning.<BR/><BR/>Strengthened by a Sunwell-empowered shield named Ban'dinoriel (\"Gatekeeper\" in Thalassian) which interconnected at ley lines throughout the land, Silvermoon was well-protected from would-be invaders. The elves constructed all manners of arcane indulgences over the years, including runestones to protect their lands, crystals to power their experimentations,<BR/><BR/>Silvermoon City stood strong for millennia in the face of several conflicts within Quel'Thalas. The Troll Wars, perpetrated by the vengeful Amani empire (whom the high elves had banished after their exodus to Quel'Thalas), was among the first. Silvermoon established a long-lasting friendship with Dalaran after the war's climax, which lasted for over 2,000 years.<BR/><BR/>From its founding to the Third War (a period of roughly 7,000 years),</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Second War</H1><P><BR/>During the Second War, the Amani entered into an alliance with the Old Horde, on the condition that the orcs help displace the elves from Quel'Thalas. Silvermoon itself was left relatively unscathed thanks to Ban'dinoriel, which erected a magical barrier over the city making it impervious to the Horde's dragon fire, though the trolls launched a heavy offensive into Eversong and in some cases came close to the capital. The city also had the protection the runestones provided, whose mysteries proved difficult even for the practiced orc warlocks to decipher. The Amani had spent many years trying to torture information regarding the runestones out of captured elves in the hope of using them to subvert Silvermoon's defenses, to no avail.<BR/><BR/>King Anasterian held court in Sunstrider Spire, the stage where he and the Convocation swore to end the Amani remnants once and for all. Furthermore, Anasterian reluctantly pledged Silvermoon's strength to the Alliance of Lordaeron, due in part to Lord Anduin Lothar collecting on the debt Anasterian owed his bloodline from the Troll Wars. With the aid of Alliance forces, the elves pushed the invaders back from Silvermoon and successfully dispersed the orcs and Amani.<BR/><BR/>Despite this victory, the high elves and their allies entered into a period of mutual coldness after the war's end.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Third War</H1><P><BR/>Silvermoon remained relatively peaceful for years following the Second War, though this was not to last. Named the Scourge, a massive undead army under the command of Arthas Menethil, fresh from laying Lordaeron to waste, marched to Quel'Thalas in order to defile the Sunwell. After tearing through Eversong and overcoming the Farstriders' attempts to hold back his advance, Arthas and his armies reached Silvermoon, and demanded the elves open their gates and allow him passage. Refusing to surrender, Silvermoon's defenders rallied under the command of Grand Magister Belo'vir, who took over the defense of Silvermoon in the fallen ranger-general Sylvanas Windrunner's place. The archers, magi, priests, and dragonhawks did what they could to ward off the undead, though they were faced with impossible odds. With the help of the great traitor Dar'Khan Drathir, Arthas successfully dispelled Ban'dinoriel and left Silvermoon vulnerable to attack. Knowing the city would not hold for much longer, Belo'vir had Archmage Rommath evacuate as many civilians as he could, and the remaining soldiers left to make a stand with King Anasterian and the bulk of the Magisters on the Isle of Quel'Danas.<BR/><BR/>Silvermoon fell soon after their departure. The city was sacked, overrun with undead, and set ablaze. Its fires and smoke could be seen from Quel'Danas.<BR/><BR/>Arthas succeeded in his goal, defiling the Sunwell and bringing forth the lich Kel'Thuzad from its tainted remains. With no more reason to linger, he left Quel'Thalas in ruins, leaving behind large pockets of undead with an undead Dar'Khan for a commander. The war's outcome was devastating: 90% of the high elves had been slain, including King Anasteriasn, Belo'vir, Sylvanas, and the entire Convocation. Ranger Lord Lor'themar Theron gathered as many survivors as he could, and took over part of Silvermoon (The Bazaar) to serve as a point of congregation for others who had survived the attack. Rommath also soon returned to search for the living, clearing out groups of Scourge with his powerful magics.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Rise of the Blood Elves</H1><P><BR/>Following the decimation of the high elves, Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider rushed back to his people in Quel'Thalas. Arriving in Silvermoon, Kael paid his respects to his father -- whose body had been returned to the city -- and organized a strike team of fighters to help destroy the tainted Sunwell, now pulsating with tainted energies that threatened to destroy both the elves and land itself. Returning to Silvermoon triumphantly, Kael renamed his people the \"blood elves\" in honor of their many fallen brethren.<BR/><BR/>Kael took several of his most powerful followers to do battle with the Scourge in Lordaeron, and commanded the great ranger Lor'themar Theron to safeguard the kingdom in his absence and to find a cure for the elves' innate addiction to magic, which had become apparent in the wake of the well's destruction. The blood elves back in Quel'Thalas made little progress with this goal, drained and exhausted without the Sunwell for sustenance. The already overstretched Farstriders also made little dent in the remaining Scourge pockets. However, this one-sided struggle was soon to take an unexpected turn.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Reclamation</H1><P><BR/>Lor'themar Theron and Halduron Brightwing were approached by a contingent of magisters sent back to Quel'Thalas on the order of Kael'thas. Led by Rommath, the magi shared with their people the radical new teachings advocated by Kael'thas (and by extension, Illidan Stormrage), leading to the weary blood elves becoming reinvigorated. Under Rommath's command, the magisters quickly went about reclaiming and rebuilding much of Silvermoon City \"almost overnight,\" their great magical powers making quick work of the Scourge.<BR/><BR/>Silvermoon City was reconstructed in an elaborate manner, once more becoming a beacon of magic and power in the Eastern Kingdoms. The towering spires of Silvermoon rose skyward once again, and the entire eastern section of Silvermoon has been wholly reclaimed by the sin'dorei. The western portion, however, remains lost for the time being, though the blood elves have recently turned their attention to healing it too.<BR/><BR/>A great deal of demonic energy has been used to fully empower the city. Chained crystals, full to the top with harnessed magic, now dot the city and power up all the various magical contrivance, including many floating spires and castles. Since the blood elves are cut off from the rest of civilization by the dangerous Plaguelands, an Orb of Translocation has been made connecting Silvermoon to Undercity.<BR/><BR/>Silvermoon is ruled by the Regent Lord of Quel'Thalas, Lor'themar Theron, who holds court with the ranger-general of Silvermoon, Halduron Brightwing and the Grand Magister of Quel'Thalas, Rommath.<BR/><BR/>Silvermoon also housed an imprisoned naaru named M'uru for a time, whose powers were drained by the magisters in order to empower the Blood Knight order under Lady Liadrin's command. However, this was not to last: Prince Kael'thas, who had sworn loyalty to the Burning Legion, briefly attacked Silvermoon with his felblood servitors and stole M'uru from the Hall of Blood.<BR/><BR/>Magically-automated guardians constantly remind everyone in the city of the blood elves' leader and savior, Prince Kael'thas, by reciting lines of carefully-worded propaganda. This helps prevent the blood elven denizens of the city from forgetting to whom they owe their absolute loyalty. However when Kael'thas has betrayed his people, the Arcane Guardians have been changed to reflect Kael'thas' betrayal and give propaganda referring to Lor'themar Theron as the savior of the blood elves instead. Additionally, Silvermoon City Guardians critiqued by Champion Vranesh no longer praise Kael'thas as the \"Sun King.\"</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Recent events</H1><P><BR/>With the restoration of the Sunwell, a bright future now lies ahead for Quel'Thalas. The blood elves have turned their attention to healing the western half of Silvermoon and restoring the city to its former glory.<BR/><BR/>An artifact from Pandaria was shipped to Silvermoon by Garrosh Hellscream, who tasked the blood elves with learning more of it. Members of the Horde are sent to Silvermoon to correspond with Lor'themar Theron himself, who had set Grand Magister Rommath to the task of deducing its modus operandi. Lor'themar also called in the leader of the Sunreavers, Aethas Sunreaver, to lend his aid to the experiment, which nearly resulted in a sha being released in the city.<BR/><BR/>It was stored under the Hall of Blood, where several of Rommath's magisters (once seen draining M'uru) were magically probing it. In a conversation with the player, Rommath confirmed that the fel crystals (the green crystals) once around Silvermoon have since been removed. Later, following the Purge of Dalaran, the escaped Sunreavers were funnelled back to the safety of Silvermoon.<BR/><BR/>The city was visited by Zaela and Shokia who found Thalen Songweaver, living in an apartment. He left Silvermoon to join the True Horde.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

It is not common to call the city New Stormwind by the time of World of Warcraft, but usually simply Stormwind City.

The city is teeming with merchants who cart around their exotic wares on the cobblestone streets. In Stormwind Harbor, massive ships regularly come and go to transport cargo and passengers to or from the docks. Though the city is bustling with trade and business, Alliance citizens can also find peace and relaxation in the preserved natural local attractions of the city and the recreational activities available there. Tourists and children can be found playing and fishing around the various canals, docks, and lakes through out the city. Many have even found tranquility outside the metropolitan districts in the more rural city outskirts. Racially diverse, heavily populated, an epicenter of culture and trade, Stormwind is acknowledged by many to be the very heart of the Alliance.<BR/><BR/>Stormwind firmly backs the Alliance with its knights, priests, paladins and mages; many of whom served in the three wars against the Horde and the Scourge. Primarily a human settlement, a fair number of high elves, Ironforge dwarves, and even a few night elves and gnomes dwell here as well. Stormwind City is the home of the Academy of Arcane Sciences, the only remaining school of wizardry in the east, and the Cathedral of Light, the philosophical capital for those who follow the Holy Light. These edifices draw healers, priests, paladins and mages to the city, all of whom bolster Stormwind’s vast military. Its vigilant City Guard keep the peace within the city's towering stone walls</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Political unrest</H1><P><BR/>Though Stormwind offered what support and resources they could to the war effort in Lordaeron, they were also beset by their own internal problems. A disagreement between the Stonemasons and the House of Nobles set off a violent riot in Stormwind City itself. The chaos led to the murder of Queen Tiffin Wrynn. The Stonemasons became the terrorist organization known as the Defias Brotherhood and sowed anarchy and terror in the lands of Stormwind for the next decade. King Varian Wrynn, shaken by his wife's death, fell to a great depression. Lady Katrana Prestor took advantage of this opportunity and used politics and sorcery to politically outmaneuver the king in the coming years. Yet in time, King Varian slowly regained his political clout, with his son Anduin Wrynn being his primary inspiration.<BR/><BR/>After the dust had settled from the Third War, Varian journeyed to Theramore to speak with Lady Jaina Proudmoore regarding Horde/Alliance relations. En route, he was abducted by the Defias who had been told of his diplomatic trip through a spy rumored to live within the Kingdom of Stormwind itself. Rumors circulated that he was taken to Alcaz Island and was held captive there. These rumors were true, yet they were also false, For Varian was split into two people after a botched ritual to subdue Varians' will conducted by Onyxia. While one of the twins retained all of his Wits, charm, and paitence, the other retained his will, ferocity, and skills in battle, where the latter escaped his captivity. For the past two years following his abduction, Varian was robbed of his memories and enslaved by a Horde gladiatorial trainer called Reghar Earthfury in Kalimdor.<BR/><BR/>Shortly after King Varian was kidnapped, Bolvar Fordragon was made Regent-Lord of Stormwind and vowed to find and rescue King Varian at any cost. Lady Prestor also became a royal adviser, and convinced Highlord Bolvar Fordragon to have King Varian's 10-year-old son, Anduin Wrynn, crowned King of Stormwind, though the actual power remained in Fordragon's hands until either Varian was returned or Anduin reached the Age of Ascension. While Lord Bolvar did his best to aid the King Anduin with rulling the Kingdom, Lady Prestor secrely worked to sow chaos and discord within the Kingdom behind the scenes while pretending to aid the young king in public.<BR/><BR/>During this time the second Varian fought his way across Kalimdor to freedom, earning the nickname “Lo’Gosh,” or “ghost wolf,” while battling in the Crimson Ring. Meanwhile in Stormwind, jubilant throngs of Stormwind's subjects turned out for a massive ceremony to welcome home their king. However, the Varian that returned was arrogant, frivolous, and markedly interested in Katrana Prestor. The people of Stormwind had only been informed that the Defias had ransomed the king, but in truth, he was somehow imprisoned and ransomed back by some naga. In either case, his freedom was bought and paid for by a painful new tax. Upon his return, however, Varian seemed concerned only with spending more of his people's money, leaving affairs of state by the wayside. Anduin Wrynn was distressed by his father's change.<BR/><BR/>Eventully Lo'gosh, with the help of his allies fought their way back to Stormwind, Marching through the gates of Stormwind, Lo'Gosh and his friends were halted by General Marcus Jonathan under the direct jurisdiction of Katrana Prestor, who ordered their immediate arrest and execution as traitors. One of Varians' allies known as Reginald Windsor succeeded in convincing Marcus of his loyalty to Stormwind as they had previously served together under Turalyon.<BR/><BR/>Katrana Prestor hastily gathered soldiers only to have the false-Varian tell her that she was disobeying the chain of command and was not in charge of Stormwind. Entering Stormwind Keep, Lo'Gosh declared Katrana's masquerade was over and called her by her true name: Onyxia. Revealing her dragon form and transforming multiple guards into dragonspawn, Lo'Gosh and his allies began battle in the great hall of Stormwind Keep. The arrival of Highlord Bolvar Fordragon along with Anduin greatly aided them in securing the keep but Reginald Windsor was killed moments later by Onyxia.<BR/><BR/>Lo'Gosh engaged his doppelganger, claiming he threatened the stability of his kingdom and nearly cost the Alliance Thandol Span which came under attack by the Dark Iron dwarves while \"Varian\" did nothing, only to have his doppelganger retort he was starting to repress her spells and regain control of his actions. Anduin, surprised by seeing two Varians, urged them to stop fighting each other and face the true threat, the brood mother Onyxia. The great dragon snatched Anduin and teleported them to her lair; daring Varian to follow suit. Regrouping with their friends, Lo'Gosh and Varian were left to grieve the loss of their son. Lo'Gosh announced to their friends and allies that the final battle would end in Onyxia's Lair.<BR/><BR/>Leading a mounted charge, both Varians cut bloody swathes into Onyxia's dragonspawn ranks. Jaina disabled the impeding magical barriers while Varian and his allies used steel and magic to slay Onyxia's brood. Eventually they encountered the brood mother herself, with Anduin imprisoned under her iron grip. Onyxia held Anduin hostage, threatening to kill him if Varian didn't surrender Stormwind over to her. Anduin urged his father not to give in to her threats and Lo'Gosh agreed to fight and die with Anduin if need be. Lo'Gosh threw a knife at the dragon's claw to loosen her hold over Anduin. Anduin fell at a great height but was caught and saved by Broll Bearmantle, who had taken his raven form to catch him mid air. With Anduin's safety secured, both Varians enguaged Onyixa with all of their might.<BR/><BR/>Becoming desperate to end the fight, Onyxia began casting the spell she was going to use on Alcaz Island to kill Lo'Gosh, but Lo'Gosh's double responded by stepping in front of the blast, saying he should die because Lo'Gosh was the embodiment of the true Varian. Not willing to sacrifice his double, Lo'Gosh leapt alongside his other self hoping to save him. The magic spell became disrupted by having the two Varians in the spell, and after a moment of silence Varian emerged, his two halves fused back together.<BR/><BR/>Onyxia desperately tries to incinerate him, but Varian swiftly reached Onyxia's head and impaled her with his newly-fused elven sword, Shalamayne. With Onyxia dead, Varian reunited with his son and friends, telling them their long and noble deeds will be rewarded and Stormwind has been reborn with a new hope for the future. King Varian then decapitated Onyxia and sent her head to be hung from the ramparts of Stormwind while Broll Bearmantle summoned roots from the ground to seal her lair's entrance and to kill her unhatched progeny.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">After the death of the Lich King</H1><P><BR/>Two events happened in Stormwind after the death of the Lich King. Firstly, the Emerald Nightmare invaded Azeroth and so invaded Stormwind City. Though many inhabitants were affected by the Nightmare, some, such as Varian, were able to avoid it. The king of Stormwind was asked to lead the fight against the Nightmare in the Emerald Dream and the battle was successful. After which, Stormwind City began to rebuild from the chaos caused by the War against the Nightmare.<BR/><BR/>Later on, a great ceremony was held in honor of the thousands who died in the War against the Lich King.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Cataclysm</H1><P><BR/>When Deathwing returned in Cataclysm, he marked his revival by flying a trip around Azeroth. His massive power was enough to destroy and reshape the land where he appeared, which resulted in the shattering. Stormwind City got its share of the destruction when Deathwing swooped into it, crashed down on the city gates and wrecked parts of the city. The entire park was blown away, and his searing heat caused the towers where he landed to glow red. Afterward, he flew off, something which puzzles the city guards as they are certain he would be able to destroy the entire city if he had wanted to. Though Stormwind is still reeling from this brutal attack, the other undamaged districts are more beautiful than ever thanks to their hardworking inhabitants.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Blood of Our Fathers</H1><P><BR/>Not long after Deathwing attacked Stormwind, the Twilight's Hammer cult tried to assassinate both King Varian and his son, Prince Anduin, on the day of Remembrance Day, at the Stormwind City Cemetery which they were lured to by Archbishop Benedictus under the pretense of family bonding, while Benedictus tried to sway the masses to the Twilight hammer's cause. Later, much to everyone’s surprise, Varian arrived at the Remembrance Day Ceremony. Limping onto a stage erected for the holiday, disheveled and covered in blood, came King Varian and Prince Anduin, barely holding each other up in their fatigue. As the realization of their dire state spread, a concerned murmur arose, but Varian raised his hand in a gesture of reassurance, and the crowd grew silent. It suddenly dawned on Varian that he had never found time to prepare his Remembrance Day speech. The king paused for just a moment, trying to smile through the pain, and then realized with utmost clarity that he now knew exactly what to say. He tells the people of Stormwind that though he has his faults, as their king, he has and always will have their best interests in mind. Even after Deathwing's attack, Stormwind will always remain vigilant and stand defiantly against their enemies. They will always rebuild from tragedy, and continue to learn from adversity. Stormwind will continue to grow from every direction, forging a brighter future. Each day they are alive is a great day, for each generation finds its own way to become the greatest generation that has ever lived and become the heroes of tomorrow. Varian states that though in the past they relied on strength and steel to forge their destiny, it is not the only way. In order to restore the world, a time will come when leaders need to be healers instead of warriors, those who mend instead of those who break. Only then can they truly cure their deep ills and achieve a lasting peace. Varian watched with pride as his words stirred the hearts of his people. The populace cheered for King Varian and this new direction for Stormwind.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Mists of Pandaria</H1><P><BR/>As the Alliance achieved a critical victory against the Horde, thwarting the plans of Garrosh to unleash the horrible powers of the Divine Bell, the repairs of the damage caused by Deathwing neared completion. The front gate towers have been reconstructed, and the statue of Danath Trollbane is back in place and mended to pristine condition. Stormwind now appears more beautiful than ever. However, the area where the Park stood still appears black and charred, and the surrounding walls and buildings are still in ruins, reminding everyone of the horrors of Deathwing's power. It seems unlikely that the destroyed district will ever fully recover, due to the fact that large chunks of land mass are missing.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Legion</H1><P><BR/>The hard-working citizens of Stormwind have been hard at work rebuilding Stormwind Park. Following the death of King Varian Wrynn at the Broken Shore, His tomb was displayed in a portion of the park as well as a memorial listing the names of fallen Alliance soldiers.<BR/><BR/>Anduin Wrynn is officially crowned the new king of Stormwind.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

Far beneath the palace of Lordaeron, the Undercity held the ancient crypts and catacombs of Lordaeron's royalty, as well as the city's dungeons and sewers. Although the Undercity was only intended for prisoners and the dead, the poorest of the Lordaeron people lived within. When the Alliance captured Orgrim Doomhammer, they sent him to the Undercity; sometime later he managed to escape and wandered for many years afterwards.<BR/><BR/>Lordaeron's Capital City stood for centuries, a monument to humanity's might. In the Third War, Prince Arthas slew his father, King Terenas, in Lordaeron's throne room and ransacked the city. He planned to use Lordaeron as his capital on this continent and ordered his minions to expand the catacombs beneath the city. Then the Lich King summoned Arthas to Northrend and the work was left uncompleted.<BR/><BR/>During Arthas' exodus, Sylvanas Windrunner broke free of the Lich King’s control and took many banshees and other undead with her. With Varimathras' assistance she defeated the dreadlords that controlled the city and set her newly dubbed Forsaken to finish Arthas' job in the dungeons. The Forsaken carved the Undercity and now rule the surrounding countryside.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">The Battle For The Undercity</H1><P><BR/>While the forces of the Horde and the Alliance were concentrated on a joint effort at Angrathar the Wrathgate, an uprising broke out within the Undercity. Demons of the Burning Legion and Forsaken rebels led by the dreadlord Varimathras and Grand Apothecary Putress managed to take control of the Undercity, killing several Forsaken and nearly killing the Dark Lady as well. In response the Horde led by Sylvanas Windrunner and Warchief Thrall attacked from the front entrance to reclaim the city. While the Alliance led by Varian and Jaina attacked from Sewers to restore Lordaeron to the Alliance. The ensuing battle ultimately killed both Varimathras and Putress, along with their fellow demons and Forsaken rebels.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

Westfall fell to bitter humans soon after the Second War. The Defias Brotherhood, led by Edwin VanCleef, attempted to take Elwynn Forest but failed. Its members chose Westfall as their new home, and the farmers, still shaken from the Horde attacks, put up little resistance. The Brotherhood found that the time to steal land from their own accepted ruler was when he was too concerned with orcs, undead and demons to realize that a good chunk of the continent was gone. The rulers at Stormwind, even with knowledge of the Brotherhood's actions, considered other threats to be higher priorities and figured they'd get to Westfall eventually. They do not know the true threat Westfall presents — or even how much the city would miss the agricultural tributes the farmers made.<BR/><BR/>Once the breadbasket of the kingdom of Stormwind, the land of Westfall started to grow fallow after years of conflict and neglect had diminished its harvests. Crops could eventually no longer be cultivated in the fields, and the once-abundant mines were ultimately deserted. Even the former defenders from Stormwind pulled stake and abandoned the lonely realm when the cost of upkeep became too great.<BR/><BR/>Due to this lack of military protection, Westfall was all but destroyed by the rebel Defias Brotherhood and its minions; who could easily take control of the poorly defended farmlands and burn their fields and salt the earth. Employing everything from local superstitions to sabotaging mechanical harvest watchers, the Brotherhood stopped at nothing to scare away trespassers and protect their stolen treasures. Only the People's Militia, a volunteer military organization, has risen to stand in their way, recruiting young heroes of the Alliance to strike back and regain what has been stolen. Under Gryan Stoutmantle's command, heroes of the Alliance struck down the leaders of the Defias in the Deadmines, effectively subduing the Brotherhood. With the People's Militia renaming themselves the Westfall Brigade and moving their troops into Grizzly Hills, it was suggested that the Defias Brotherhood threat died down.<BR/><BR/>After the War against the Lich King, many people living in Westfall became homeless and bankrupt. Those who weren't in a military occupation faced especially hard times. Westfall is now inhabited by transients, homeless Stormwind Citizens and drifters. The farmlands, still reeling from years of neglect and desolation, are still as barren as ever. The Westfall Brigade, having returned from the war in Northrend, now seeks to secure the region and restore it to its former glory; but the resurgence of an old and familiar enemy hinder their efforts.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

It's not that the Empress is getting more strategic; in fact, her whole society is in the middle of an upheaval. Shek'zeer has been overwhelmed and possessed by the Sha of Fear, and she's running her empire into the ground.

The mountains of this land were shaped by Mogu hands before they succumbed to the Curse of Flesh. Eventually, Kun Lai Summit was heavily contested along with the rest of Pandaria by several different Mogu clans. Soon after, many different races of Pandaria, including the Mountain Hozen, Jinyu, and even early Pandaren farmers came to inhabit the region. The Summit was watched over by Xuen, the White Tiger, who swore to protect the races of Kun Lai from outsiders. When Lei Shen and his mogu legions marched upon Kun-Lai Summit, he gave the citizens the chance to remain free. A single challenger was meant to face Lei Shen. If he won, Lei Shen would leave the lands alone. However, if he lost, the citizens of Kun-Lai Summit would bow before the Thunder King. His challenge was accepted by Xuen, and their battle raged for thirty days and thirty nights. In the end, Lei Shen was triumphant, and the lands of Kun-Lai Summit were shortly thereafter conquered and enslaved by Lei Shen, with minimal opposition.<BR/><BR/>After the Pandaren revolution, and the Zandalari Troll Wars that followed, Kun-Lai Summit became a free state under control by the Pandaren Empire from their seat in the Jade Forest.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Mists of Pandaria</H1><P><BR/>The lands have been peaceful for the past ten thousand years, until outsiders arrived in Pandaria.

The Yaungol invasion has left the Pandaren farmlands occupied and devastated, the invasion empowering the Sha even further. The Shado-Pan Monastery has come under attack by the Sha of Hatred from within and the Sha of Anger has risen in the South with the heightened negative emotions.<BR/><BR/>To the north, Zouchin Province on the coastline of Kun-Lai has been experiencing very peaceful times for several years. That was until a large Zandalari army led by Prophet Khar'zul and Gara'jal the Spiritbinder arrived on the shores and assaulted the Pandaren villages. A large amount of the province's pandaren population was slaughtered in the process, and the Zandalari have regained their ancient alliance with the mogu through the mountains of Kun-Lai above Zouchin Province. The Mogu have begun animating several terracotta and stone warriors to fuel their growing army which they intend to use to reclaim Pandaria. The Zandalari have also gained possession of the body of Lei Shen, who they intend to resurrect. Taking him to the Isle of Reckoning along with their Mogu allies, Prophet Khar'zul succeeded in resurrecting the fallen First Emperor. The Zandalari then launched a full scale assault on Zouchin Village, while the Horde and Alliance managed to help the Pandaren villagers win a Pyrrhic victory over the rebels. Most of the Mogu and Zandalari in Kun-Lai have since fled with the Thunder King to his island citadel, where they intend to unite into a single army commanded by Lei Shen to reconquer Pandaria for him.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Landfall</H1><P><BR/>Seeking the Divine Bell, Warchief Hellscream orders Horde forces to enter the region and discover its location.

Meanwhile, the mantid are encroaching from the south. The sacred Niuzao Temple is under siege, and a splinter sect of Mogu are trying to create their own dark demigod on an island off the coast.<BR/><BR/>Eventually, the mantid assault on Niuzao Temple and Townlong was discontinued with the death of Grand Empress Shek'zeer. Next, the Shan'ze Mogu led by the dreaded Shan Bu besieged Niuzao Temple. Mogu siege engines managed to break through the Pandaren defenders, nearly annihilating them in the process. After the Shan'ze occupied the inner courtyards, Shan Bu himself entered the temple and put Niuzao under a spell. After Niuzao refused to give up, Shan Bu ordered the watching Mogu and cloud serpents to launch a final assault on the defenders. However, the mogu failed in their assault, and were driven off of Niuzao Island. Shan Bu and the Shan'ze simply returned to the Isle of Thunder and formed up with Lei Shen's enormous legions. Shan Bu left some Mogu behind to secure Shan'ze Dao for the Thunder King.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}
	,{["id"] = 811	,["continent"] = 5	,["name"] = "Vale of Eternal Blossoms"				,["lore"] = "<HTML><BODY><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Ancient history</H1><P><BR/>In the years that the Titans were on Azeroth, the Vale of Eternal Blossoms was a place Freya created and experiment with forms of life, like Un'Goro Crater and Sholazar Basin. All three locations were places where the power of the Well of Eternity had coalesced. The Wild Gods emerged from these cradles of life.<BR/><BR/>At the same time, they were fighting the Old Gods and their servants, the mantid, so they created the mogu to be guardians of the Vale and fight off the waves of mantid. When the Old Gods were defeated and the Titans became silent, the mogu continued their work until the Curse of Flesh swept through the land. Unsure of what to do, the mogu started forming into clans and began fighting with each other, until Lei Shen rose and united the clans. Lei Shen and his mogu enslaved the creatures of Pandaria and forced them to build the Great Wall to block the mantid from his new empire, and protect the Vale at the same time.<BR/><BR/>The jinyu had their beginnings in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, evolving from murlocs fortunate enough to live near the enchanted pools of the Vale. The magic of the pools expanded their minds and grew their bodies, until they became one of the great ancient cultures of Pandaria. At some time following the departure of the Titans, but before the rise of Lei Shen, the jinyu empire ruled over Pandaria from the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. During the reign of mogu emperor Lei Shen, the mogu invaded the jinyu kingdoms and slaughtered all who opposed them, presumably wresting from them control of the Vale.<BR/><BR/>When the mogu were overthrown by the pandaren, the capital was moved east to the Jade Forest, and the Vale's gates were closed off to the outside world. Within the Vale, a small group of specially chosen caretakers known as the Golden Lotus kept watch over the Vale, keeping it pristine and safe, with occasional help from the Shado-Pan.<BR/><BR/>Shortly before the Great Sundering, Emperor Shaohao traveled to the Vale after having purged himself of his burdens, and it was in the Vale that Shaohao became one with the land to save Pandaria from the Sundering. It is said that all the trees in the vale blossomed as he entered, and continued to blossom for thousands of years.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Mists of Pandaria</H1><P><BR/>In more recent times, the Golden Lotus have become increasingly concerned after spotting mogu scouts that somehow circumvented the gates. They are in need of the Shado-Pan's aid again, and perhaps new strangers as well, should they prove worthy of the privilege. They quickly discover that the mogu intend something grander than simple scouting within the Vale. Xin the Weaponmaster has gathered several Mogu clans under his banner at Mogu'shan Palace and the Shao-Tien to the west have begun a full-scale assault on the Vale, and their plot ties in with the return of the master of all mogu, the dreaded Thunder King himself.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Bleeding Sun</H1><P><BR/>The Golden Lotus learned that a child within the Vale was destined to join their order, but after testing several pandaren children at the Shrine were unable to locate the child. Chi-Ji then appeared and found his way to Dezco's sons, announcing that one of them was destined to serve the vale. The Tauren unwilling to be departed from either of his children decided to leave the Vale and return to Mulgore in secret. However he was intercepted by Mokimo the Strong, Weng the Merciful and Rook who choose to protect until he had left. However the group was ambushed by the Shao-Tien mogu, and in the end only one of Dezco's two sons survived. While Dezco was free to leave for Mulgore, he decided to give Redhorn to Mokimo in order for him to serve the Vale and the Golden Lotus.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Vol'jin: Shadows of the Horde</H1><P><BR/>Following the rebirth of the Thunder King, Lei Shen ordered the Zandalari to begin the process of resurrecting his generals. Learning this Vol'jin, Tyrathan Khort, and the Shado-pan allies sought to prevent the resurrection of Warlord Kao. However despite their best efforts the group was captured, Brother Dao and Brother Shan used as two of the four sacrifices and Warlord Kao was reborn. The quick actions of Vol'jin and Khal'ak protected the lives of Chen Stormstout and Brother Cuo from the Mogu's wrath. Disgruntled at this Warlord Kao directed the Zandalari to return him to his master and the group, prisoners and all, departed for the Isle of Thunder.</P><BR/><H1 ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Siege of Orgrimmar</H1><P><BR/>The Vale's desecration by the Horde excavation and subsequent unearthing of the Heart of Y'Shaarj by Garrosh has stirred the final Sha prime, the Sha of Pride. The immense corruption laid waste to the once beautiful landscape, and the lesser sha now roam the swath. Mogu'shan Palace and the mogu statues were also damaged. The Eternal Blossoms, the namesake of the Vale, started to die despite having once been said to never wilt.<BR/><BR/>The water pools have been warped by the Sha energies and reformed into an elemental horror, Immerseus.<BR/><BR/>The August Celestials have determined that they will work together to rebuild the Vale. By the time of the Iron Horde's invasion of Azeroth, the Vale has been cleansed.</P><BR/></BODY></HTML>"}

Alongside Alliance and Horde explorers, he'll discover the ancestral home of the Stormstout for the first time, and strive to live up to his family's name and legacy of peerless brewing. But not all is idyllic within the Valley. The ravenous appetites of long-toothed virmen and simian hozen endanger crops and farmers alike... and threaten the entire continent with starvation. If you can stop these animalistic pillagers, you’ll be able to grab a plow and a shovel and cultivate Pandaria's fallow farmlands once again.

Thus, the remaining energies were trapped within a talisman of elemental binding, which Ragnaros split into two perfect halves which he gave to his two lieutenants. Rumour has it that Executus supplanted Baron Geddon, and the two have been rivals ever since. Although this rumour has yet to be confirmed, there is certainly no doubt that Ragnaros does not tolerate failure. Thus, the lesser flamewakers (and, of course, Baron Geddon) eagerly awaited a misstep by Executus, anticipating their chance to vie for the coveted attention of the Firelord.\n\nBaron Geddon guarded one half of the talisman deep within the fiery confines of Blackrock Depths. Though the two have fought side by side for countless millennia, Baron Geddon harbored suspicious that Garr would seek to supplant him as the sole guardian of the talisman. Geddon, therefore, remained ever cautious of his former comrade. In fact, it was Shazzrah who sought to posses both halves of the talisman so that he might find a way to siphon its energies for his own use.\n\nGeddon also taught a fire elemental by the name of Lord Incendius to harness his destructive powers, but the baron never expected his protégé to grow so lethally efficient.

Aviana spent years melding her power into the tree, and soon all winged creatures of Azeroth dreamed of spending the afterlife flying through its branches. Her spirit became tied with G'Hanir, and in time this would have lasting consequences.\n\nWhen the red dragon Korialstrasz, trapped in his mortal disguise Krasus, was unable to fly, Aviana gifted him a feather which granted him temporary wings. During the War of the Ancients, Aviana was one of many Ancient Guardians who came to the aid of the night elves in defense of their world. Though the shock of their attack initially gave them an edge, the endless numbers of the Burning Legion eventually overwhelmed many of them. Aviana was knocked from the sky and Rhonin witnessed her lifeless body fall when a large group of demons attacked her. The doomguard surrounded her and pierced her body with their spears. When Aviana was killed, her realm tree G'Hanir died. The first druids found her body among the carnage, and bore it up to the highest mountain. She was laid to rest just outside the Shrine of Aviana, within a circle of sacred stones.\n\nFor ten thousand years Aviana drifted formless in the Emerald Dream while the mortal races continued to worship her; the Druids of the Talon in particular focused their worship around her and learned to take the forms of raven and crows. Her children, the harpies, descended into violence and barbaric behaviour, and eventually forsook their parent for other, darker masters, or struck out on their own. Some worshippers believed Aviana to have survived her death at the hands of demons, and others claimed to have actually had contact with her.

It describes how Malorne, being hunted by the tauren, bargained with Elune in exchange for help. Malorne accepted Elune's help and loved her as part of the deal.\n\nAnother version of the tale says that Malorne fell in love with the goddess of the moon during the world's first nightfall. Her light guided him through the woods and showed him he was not alone. It banished fear and brought hope. Many creatures have loved the moon and pursued her to madness. She grants light as she will, on her own timetable, and moonlight cannot be captured or possessed. Even so, night after night, the White Stag chased her across the skies. He grew so swift and strong that at last he succeeded in reaching her. She was so moved by his devotion and beauty that she made him her consort. To this day he loves the wilds best when they are lit by her radiance.\n\nWhatever the truth may be, eventually Malorne became Elune's consort. Elune gave birth to Cenarius from that relationship. Because Ysera the Dreamer agreed to act as Cenarius' foster mother, she has often been mistaken for the demigod's true mother. As a result, there are also rumors that she and Malorne had a romantic relationship. However, such rumors are baseless, though Ysera had a deep affection and respect for the demigod. He was one of nature's mightiest champions and a frequent visitor to the Emerald Dream.\n\nDuring the War of the Ancients, Cenarius appealed to Malorne and the other demigods of Azeroth to join the battle against the Burning Legion. After much debate, Cenarius persuaded them to unite under the command of Captain Jarod Shadowsong, who was leading a large army of night elves and other creatures against the Legion. Cenarius had gone into a frenzy seeing Ursol, Ursoc, Aviana, and Agamaggan die. Cenarius crushed hundreds of felguards and felhunters. The demons finally got hold of Cenarius, but before the demons could slay him, Malorne came into the fray blinding all demons with his majestic white flashing body. Malorne's hooves crushed many demons, while his antlers killed many others. Malorne defended his son Cenarius, and with a look toward the elves as if telepathically commanding them to come for his son, Jarod Shadowsong and others dragged Cenarius to safety.\n\nMalorne's fury might have begun to turn the tide against the Burning Legion, had Archimonde not appeared. Black lightning struck the land around Malorne, baking it, then green fire from the ground engulfed Malorne, burning at his coat, while the land and rock formed giant hands that pinned his four legs to the ground. Archimonde swelled in size matching Malorne's height. Malorne freed himself from his magical trap, and charged Archimonde with his antlers, causing tremors and lightning as demons and Azeroth' races nearby shook and fell to the ground flat on their backs with astonishment. Malorne and Archimonde battled for some time, until, finally, Archimonde managed to seize Malorne and with great force snapped his neck. Cenarius's brave rescuer and father, limp and lifeless, was tossed aside by Archimonde. Malfurion knowing Cenarius was unconscious and that Archimonde had just slain Malorne, cast a spell that engulfed most of Archimonde's body with vines. The Archdemon, analytical as always, decided to retreat by vanishing in a green flare of flames that consumed the vines.\n\nShortly thereafter, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Soridormi, along with their dragonflights, joined the War of the Ancients. Ysera came to a screeching halt at the sight of Malorne and opened wide her brilliant jade eyes (one of only a few times she did so in recorded history) with a deafening shriek. As she tore through the carnage to her friend, thousands of demons were thrown in all directions with her paws and wings. Her rampage continued, making her way through to her goal, until she came still, her chin on Malorne's head; sobs could be heard as She of the Dreaming mourned the White Stag's end."}
